<p>Isn‚Äôt the subtitle seems great?<br />
Enjoy the conversation:-</p>
<p>Q. Hey! what do you do?<br />
A. Anything with the data.</p>
<p>Q. Great! Do you do data visualization?<br />
A. Yeah! With data from any sector. (Thanks to #ggplot2)</p>
<p>Q. Publishing quality?<br />
A. Yeah! for book, web, journal, anything. (Thanks to #rmarkdown #pandoc #tinytex)</p>
<p>Q. I have data on a few websites. Should I share that?¬†Can you download/scrape that?<br />
A. Yeah, please share the URL. (Thanks to #readr, #readxl, #rvest).</p>
<p>Q. Actually, data on the website contains the values in different units and there are a lot of other variables. Can you clean that?<br />
A. That‚Äôs my job. I will clean the data set as you wish. (Thanks to #dplyr, #lubridate and #tidyverse )</p>
<p>Q. Thank you very much. I need a map also showing the values for a different region of this XYZ county. Do you do that?<br />
A. Thanks for letting me know that. I will do that as well. (Thanks to #tmap, #leaflet, #sf, #ggplot2)</p>
<p>Q. In which format do you provide the graphs? png, tiff?<br />
Q. Any format! as you wish! (Thanks to #grDevices)</p>
<p>Q. I need to publish the graphs on some digital platform too. So, do you provide SVG, too?<br />
A. Of course! let me know your requirements!</p>
<p>Q. Awesome! Can you provide the pixel and resolution (dpi) as specified?<br />
Q. Of course! Let me know your specification. (Again thanks to #grDevices)</p>
<p>Q. Can you please show me a quick sample? How the plot will look?<br />
A. Yeah sure. (Thanks to #esquisse, #shiny)</p>
<p>Q. Hey, the plot looks great. Can you please write data values on the bars, make the axis text a little more clear, change the font of all the text, remove the background of the ligand, move ligand here (tick mark), etc etc.<br />
A. Just a few minutes please! (thanks to #ggplot2, #fontextra, #scales)</p>
<p>Q. This looks great! Can you show me a few more varieties?<br />
A. Ok. Just a minute. Let me show you different professional themes. (Thanks to #ggthemes)</p>
<p>Q. Wow! That‚Äôs it, man! Thanks a lot for such an amazing job. Please send the files.<br />
A. Ok. Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Q. These are some amazing works. I like this two. Can you send me both?<br />
A. Yeah! No issue! Just a minute!</p>
<p>Q. Thank you very much for this amazing work. One thing I wanted to ask is, Can I reproduce the plots in the future for updated data?<br />
A. Yeah! Please let me know when the new data is available. I will reproduce these plots in a few minutes. exactly as it is. (Thanks to #rlanguage and #RStudio)</p>
<p>Q. That‚Äôs really, amazing! Thanks a lot, man. Sure, I would like to reproducible these plots for updated data. See you then. Thank you.<br />
A. Thank you, too.üçπüçπ</p>
<p>So, did you understand how handy RStudio and R programming language could be for your research and for making publication-quality graphsüòä.<br />
Got any other questions regarding making publication-quality graphs?¬†Feel free to leave your comments. I will explore the possibilities and will answer your queries.<br />
I will soon post a follow-up post showing the technical process (codes) of doing the things explained here. Stay connected.<br />
