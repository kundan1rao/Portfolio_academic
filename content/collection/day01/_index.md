Hii,
I will do EDA, i.e., exploratory data analysis for your data set in R programming language using RStudio.
The significant steps include:-
1. Data exploration
(Data types of features, dimension of the dataset, missing and null values)

2. Data description
( necessary comments after data exploration)

3. Data pre-processing
(Type conversion, data cleaning, data transformation, etc.)

4. Univariate EDA
(Necessary graphs, charts, maps, tables, Histogram, boxplots and density plot of features, etc.)

5. Bivariate EDA
(Scatter plot between the features, time series plot, etc)

6. Multivariate EDA
(Correlation matrix, correlation plots, heat maps, faceted plots, etc.)

I will include any other necessary tables, charts, stories, maps. I will also have the essential latex equations (although I suppose there would be fewer equations to type for the specified price).
I will share your results in many file formats like word, pdf, HTML, slides, etc.

Feel free to discuss your specific requirements.
